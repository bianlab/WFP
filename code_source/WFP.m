% This function runs the WFP algorithm.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Output: z0: n1 * n2, spectrum initialization (for result comparison);
%         im_r: n1 * n2, recovered HR pluraql image;
%         Relerrs: recovery errors in each iteration.
% Input:  Y: n1_LR * n2_LR * L, captured LR images;
%         n1 and n2 are the pixel numbers of im_r (HR) in two dimensions;
%         sigma2: variance of additive noise;
%         Masks: L * 2 (each point indicates the index of the left-upper point of the LR image in the HR spectrum);
%         pupil: the pupil function;
%         T: the number of iteration;
%         mu_max: the stepsize parameter;
%         weight: the weighting parameter;
%         newfolder: folder for saving results;
%         x: original benchmark HR spectrum for calculating recovery error.
