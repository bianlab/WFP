% This function operates the inverse linear transform on the signal xx_c.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Output: xx_mean_large: n1 * n2, original signal (HR spectrum).
% Input:  xx_c: n1_LR * n2_LR * L, sampling output (without abs)
%         Masks: L * 2 (each point indicates the index of the left-upper point of the LR image in the HR spectrum)
%         n1 and n2 are the pixel numbers of xx_mean_large (HR) in two dimensions
%         pupil: the pupil function.
