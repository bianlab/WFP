% This function operates the linear transform on the signal xx (namely "A").
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Output: xx_c: n1_LR * n2_LR * L, sampling output (without abs).
% Input:  xx: n1 * n2, original signal (HR spectrum);
%         Masks: L * 2 (each point indicates the index of the left-upper point of the LR image in the HR spectrum);
%         n1_LR and n2_LR are the pixel numbers of xx_c (LR) in two dimensions;
%         pupil: the pupil function.
